They shall be deployed using AWS Fargate, which allows you to run containers without managing servers. We shall deploy two instances of Gateway container and 2 instances of ColorTeller. ColorTeller containers register with a Route53 private hosted zone. ColorGateway discovers the ColorTeller via a service lookup to Route53. We will use an Application load balancer to route the requests to ColorGateway.
